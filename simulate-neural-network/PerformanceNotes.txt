One Behavior Subject. Neuron subscribes, receives connection, and checks if it is an output neuron of connection.
10,000 - 1 second
15,000 - 3 seconds
20,000 - 6 seconds
30,000 - 11 seconds
40,000 - 25 seconds
100,000 > 2 minutes


One Behavior Subject for every neuron - emits when neuron is firing. 
Two behavior subjects that emit when neuron is created and when connection is created/destroyed
3,000 - 4 seconds
4,000 - 9 seconds
5,000 - 18 seconds
